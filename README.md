# Heltec LoraWan

I bought a couple of Heltec devices from `flyfun_diymall` on ebay, and want
to experiment with them. They communicate over 2 bands: the 2.4 GHz wifi
frequencies, and the 900MHz band formerly used for wireless telephones back
in the 80s (?). But no instructions came with these, and the seller just
sent me some links, so I'll try to document my progress here.
